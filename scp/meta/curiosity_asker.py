TẠI SAO: Behavioral test test_v10439_g expects this module to exist with an
entity guard: skip question generation when no entity is provided (was: using
question[:50] as fallback → garbage entities → bad follow-ups).

The module was previously deleted during refactor. This restore provides the
entity-guarded asker + documents the contract.
