SCP V90 — Reality Judge Module
Cross-check SLMs, verify with reality, produce final verdicts.
Extracted from engine.py for modularity.

[G4-FIX P0-12] REALITY-CHECK ON THE "10-PHASE PIPELINE" CLAIM:
The project doc (SCP_FULL_CONTEXT_FOR_AI.md §2.2) claims judge.judge() is a
"10-phase pipeline" (Phase 1 DoS → 2 Multimodal → 3 Chatbot → 4 SmartClassifier
→ 5 SLM → 6 KB → 7 Reality → 8 Consistency → 9 Governance → 10 Antibody →
11 API boundary). That claim is FICTION. The ACTUAL judge() method (this file,
L74-2305, 2232 LOC, CC≈300) is a single god method with ~27 distinct phases
whose inline numbering is contradictory (PHASE 1 / STEP 0 / Step 1 / Step 2 /
Step 5.5 / Step 6 / Step 7 / Step 9 / STEP 9-again / PHASE 6 / PHASE 6.5 /
PHASE 10 / PHASE 11 — see judge() docstring for the full table).

`scp/runtime/judge_parts/judge_phases.py` defines only 6 phases and is NOT
wired into THIS method. It runs in SHADOW MODE from judge.py:927 (the async
wrapper `judge_async`) for comparison logging only — never sets the production
verdict. See that file's docstring for its honest status.

Full split of judge() into 10 phase modules = 21-day refactor, DEFERRED
(worklog Task G4-C). This file documents reality instead of pretending.

        Total: 28 distinct phases/steps across L178-2375 (2198 LOC of method body
        after this 84-line docstring). Phase numbering in inline comments is
        CONTRADICTORY: code says "PHASE 1" at L227 (KB), "STEP 0" at L264 (security,
        AFTER Phase 1), "Step 1" at L503 (routing), "Step 2" at L562 (SLMs),
        "Step 5.5" at L929 (adversary), "Step 6" at L990 (verdict), "Step 7" at
        L1350 (reality), "Step 9" at L1466 (verdict construction), "STEP 9" again
        at L1922 (counter response — same number as verdict construction!),
        "PHASE 6" at L2092 (antibodies — after Step 9 counter response),
        "PHASE 6.5" at L2118, "PHASE 10" at L2160, "PHASE 11" at L2207. Phases
        7-9 of the doc's "10-phase pipeline" do not map to any single contiguous
        code block — they are interleaved across the 28 actual steps.
