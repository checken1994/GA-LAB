[OPT-8] Judge phases — extracted from judgecore_mixin.judge() for modularity.

[G4-FIX P0-12] HONEST STATUS (audited 2026-XX-XX by Task G4-C):
  - PARTIALLY WIRED via SHADOW MODE only. `run_all_phases_sync` is called from
    `judge.py:927` (inside `judge_async`, the async wrapper) for COMPARISON
    LOGGING — it never sets the production verdict. The actual production
    verdict path is `judgecore_mixin.JudgeCoreMixin.judge()` (L92-2375, 2284 LOC
    — was L74-2305 / 2232 LOC before the G4-C docstring audit added ~70 lines)
    — see its docstring for the REAL 28-step pipeline.
  - The 6 phases defined here are ASPIRATIONAL SCAFFOLDING for a future
    async refactor (Task 3), NOT the actual judge() pipeline. The doc's
    "10-phase pipeline" claim (SCP_FULL_CONTEXT_FOR_AI.md §2.2) is FICTION.
  - Known functional bugs in the shadow-mode phases:
      * phase3_slm_predict (line ~145): [G4-phase3 FIXED] was calling
        `judge._route_question(question)` which returns `list[str]` (domain
        names, e.g. `["math"]`) and storing that LIST in `ctx.slm_responses[0]`
        — semantically wrong. Downstream phases (4, 5) then did
        `str(ctx.slm_responses[0])` and "verified" the string `"['math']"` as
        if it were an answer claim. FIX: routed domains are now stored in
        the dedicated `ctx.routed_domains` field (added to JudgeContext by
        Task G4-phase3). `ctx.slm_responses` is left empty (no SLM was
        actually invoked in shadow mode — real SLM calls happen in
        judgecore_mixin.judge() Step 2 at L562-714). phase4/phase5 now
        correctly fall through to `ctx.ai_answer or ""` and skip their work
        when no claim is present.
      * phase4_falsification: was previously reported as dead due to attribute
        mismatch (`falsification_engine` vs `falsification`). Re-audit:
        `judge.py:305` DOES set `self.falsification_engine` (matching the
        `hasattr` check at line 165 of this file). The worklog finding #15b
        was inaccurate on this point. phase4 is technically callable, but its
        input is now empty (post-G4-phase3 fix) since no SLM answer is
        captured in shadow mode.
      * phase5_antibodies, phase6_verdict_construction: now see an empty
        `ctx.slm_responses` (post-G4-phase3 fix) → metadata correctly reports
        no SLM answer was produced, rather than producing garbage from
        `"['math']"`.
  - Net effect: shadow mode runs every call. Post-G4-phase3 fix the comparison
    verdict is no longer computed from garbage metadata (routed domains are
    correctly stored separately), but it is still computed from an EMPTY
    `slm_responses` list since shadow mode does not actually invoke SLMs. The
    `_phase_match_count` / `_phase_divergence_count` counters at judge.py:935-953
    therefore remain untrustworthy for deciding when to "switch to phase-based
    verdict" until phase3 is upgraded to actually call `judge.slms[domain].predict()`.

WHY this file still exists (not deleted):
  - Deleting it would force a cascade of edits in judge.py (lines 653-655,
    796-849, 909-967 reference judge_phases / run_all_phases_sync / JudgeContext).
  - The 6 phase signatures ARE a useful skeleton for the future async refactor.
  - Keeping it + this honest docstring lets future devs see the gap between
    aspiration and reality without re-discovering it the hard way.

WHY extract (not modify judge() directly — too risky for 2541 LOC):
  - judge() has CC≈300 (worklog claim of "CC=551" was inaccurate; re-audit
    shows the file is 2979 LOC total, judge() is L92-2375 = 2284 LOC).
    Still a god method — needs refactor, deferred (full split = 21 days).
  - Phases are logically independent: phase1_input_validation, phase2_routing,
    phase3_slm_predict, phase4_falsification, phase5_antibodies, etc.
  - Extracting into methods makes each phase testable independently.
  - Prepares for async refactor (Task 3): each phase can become async.

Pattern:
  - Each phase method takes (judge_instance, ctx: dict) -> dict (updated ctx)
  - ctx carries question, ai_answer, verdict, slm_responses, etc.
  - Phase methods DON'T call each other — judge() orchestrates
  - Phase methods are PURE (no side effects except logging)

Usage (future, after async refactor):
    async def judge(self, question, ai_answer, ...):
        ctx = {"question": question, "ai_answer": ai_answer, ...}
        ctx = await phase1_input_validation(self, ctx)
        ctx = await phase2_routing(self, ctx)
        ctx = await phase3_slm_predict(self, ctx)
        # ... etc.
        return ctx["verdict"]

Current status: SHADOW MODE ONLY (judge.py:927). The actual judge() in
judgecore_mixin.py is UNCHANGED — its real 28-step pipeline is documented
in the judge() docstring (added by Task G4-C).
