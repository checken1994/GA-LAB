"""
[OPT-2] Lightweight ReActAgent — multi-tool coordination WITHOUT LangChain.

Why not LangChain:
  - 200MB+ dependency overhead
  - Lock-in to their abstractions
  - SCP already has SmartClassifier + FalsificationEngine — reuse them

Architecture (ReAct pattern):
  Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → ... → Final Answer

Tools available (reuse existing SCP modules):
  - DataSource.query(question) — 35 data sources
  - SLM.ask(question) — 53 SLMs
  - LLMGateway.chat(question) — Ollama + OpenRouter
  - FalsificationEngine.verify(claim, evidence) — reality check

Stops when:
  - confidence >= 0.8 (success)
  - max_iterations reached (failure → escalate)
  - contradiction detected (escalate to human)
