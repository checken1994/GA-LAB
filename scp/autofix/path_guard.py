"""[S3-SECURITY-SWEEP] Path guard for autofix storage paths.

TẠI SAO module này tồn tại?
  Mimosa sweep 3 flagged HIGH path-traversal findings across the autofix
  cache/log/registry writers: caller/config-supplied paths flow into
  file writers and ``os.replace`` without normalization or containment.
  A hostile or buggy caller (finding-driven filename, corrupted config) could
  point those writers outside the intended directory.

  ROOT fix: every storage path used by a cache/log/registry writer is
  normalized here:
    - explicit parent-directory traversal components → REJECTED, fall back to
      the module's safe default (fail-closed for writes),
    - result is always an absolute, resolved Path,
    - untrusted filename stems (e.g. shadow files derived from finding
      filenames) are reduced to a safe charset with a sha256 fallback.

  Behavior for legitimate paths (absolute tmp dirs, relative project paths)
  is unchanged — only traversal-shaped input is rejected.

DNA principles applied:
  #4  (Constitution KILL) — traversal components never reach a write sink
  #7  (Autofix safe)      — reject → fall back to default, engine keeps working
  #9  (No harm)           — writes stay inside the intended directory
  #26 (Reality > Model)   — tests/T03_capability/test_security_sweep_s3.py
                            proves traversal is rejected at runtime
