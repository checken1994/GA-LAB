 * Audit data index — re-exports all separate task files

 * Per user instruction "tách các nhiệm vụ khác nhau thành từng file riêng lẻ"
 * (split different tasks into separate files), each task lives in its own file.
 * This index just re-exports for convenient imports.
 *
 * R8 adds: round8 (7 new bugs), round9-self-audit (10 SA-R8 findings),
 * autofix-v3 (6 v3 improvements + world-tools comparison).
 *
 * R9 adds: round9 (7 NEW bugs R8 missed), round10-self-audit (6 SA-R9 findings
 * auditing R8), autofix-v4 (6 v4 improvements IMP-19..24 + 8 NEW world tools).
