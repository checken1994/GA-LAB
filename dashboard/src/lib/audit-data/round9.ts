/**
 * Round 9 Findings — 7 NEW root-cause bugs R8 MISSED (DNA #22 recursive level 3)
 *
 * R8 reported "7 fixes applied" + "7 NEW bugs found" — but PASS ≠ TRUE.
 * R9 (Subagent B) does NOT trust R8's 7 was exhaustive. It re-audited the
 * SCP codebase with strengthened patterns + world-tool signatures
 * (ruff ASYNC100, semgrep race-condition, inter-procedural tracing) and
 * found 7 MORE bugs R8 MISSED — across 2 bug classes.
 *
 *   - 4 blocking-in-async (CRITICAL + 3 HIGH) — sync long-running calls
 *     inside `async def` handlers block the asyncio event loop.
 *   - 3 race conditions (1 MEDIUM, 2 LOW) — concurrent list/dict mutation
 *     without lock. R9-7 is a regression INTRODUCED by R8-1's fix.
 *
 * Each finding has: id, file:line(s), bug_class, severity, root_cause
 * (TẠI SAO — DNA #1), before_code (buggy), after_code (the suggested
 * fix / patch applied by Subagent D), world_tool inspiration,
 * repro_hypothesis, why_R8_missed, ast_parse_ok, dna_principles.

    rootCause:
      "R8-1 found that `_attack_mode_monitor` queried a non-existent SQLite notifications table (query raised sqlite3.OperationalError, swallowed by `except Exception: logger.debug`). R8-1's fix replaced the SQL query with direct iteration of the in-memory `_notif._recent` list (api_server.py:367-372). But `_recent` is mutated by `notify()` (called from judge.judge() in a worker thread) WITHOUT a lock (notifications.py:174). The R8-1 patch introduced a NEW race: the `sum(1 for _n in _recent ...)` generator expression iterates `_recent` while notify() may be appending to it concurrently. CPython's list iterator caches ob_size at creation — if notify() appends (changing ob_size) mid-iteration, the iterator raises `RuntimeError: list changed size during iteration`. The `_attack_mode_monitor`'s outer `except Exception as e: logger.debug(...)` swallows this — so the monitor silently dies and attack mode NEVER auto-enables. **THIS IS THE SAME FUNCTIONAL FAILURE R8-1 WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX** — R8-1's fix replaced one silent failure (dead SQL query) with another silent failure (race-induced crash swallowed by except). Additionally `_recent` is also accessed by `get_recent()` (line 259) and `stats()` — both called from admin endpoints (event loop thread). So `_recent` has 3 concurrent accessors (worker thread via notify, daemon thread via monitor, event loop thread via admin endpoints), ALL without a lock.",

Set up a script that sends 100 /ask requests concurrently, each triggering a KILL verdict (e.g. attack prompts that get governance-KILL'd → notify(event_type='governance_kill') called from worker threads). 2. The `_attack_mode_monitor` daemon thread polls every 5 minutes (line 385: `_time.sleep(300)`). When it polls it iterates `_recent` via `sum(1 for _n in _recent ...)`. 3. If notify() appends to `_recent` during the monitor's iteration → `RuntimeError: list changed size during iteration` → swallowed by `except Exception: logger.debug(...)` → monitor continues but kill_count is wrong (or the iteration aborts early). 4. Check debug logs: RuntimeError repeating. Attack mode never auto-enables (kill_count stays at 0 or returns partial count).",
    whyR8Missed:
      "R8-1's fix was focused on replacing the dead SQL query with a working in-memory read. The fix verified that `_recent` exists and contains the right data — but did NOT consider thread safety. R8-1's repro hypothesis was 'send 50 attack prompts, check eng.in_attack_mode' — which would PASS if the monitor happened to iterate when no notify() was in flight (the race window is small). The race only crashes under concurrent load, which R8-1's hypothesis test did not exercise. **THIS IS DNA #22 (PASS ≠ TRUE) APPLIED TO R8 ITSELF**: R8-1's fix PASSED its hypothesis test but introduced a NEW silent failure.",
